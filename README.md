# Diabetic-Retinopathy

Diabetic retinopathy is a condition suffered by people who have diabeties, which leads to permenent blindness if not treated in time.

We propose a novel and efficient method to diagnose retinopathy from retinal fundas images using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks.

The model is 70% accurate in classifying Diabetic Retinopathy.
